It should be possible to run the tool without severe limitations also with the limited resolution of a beamer.\r\n* **Show-off:** Demonstrate that Python is a potent tool for digital signal processing applications as well. The interfaces for textual filter design routines are a nightmare: linear vs. logarithmic specs, frequencies normalized w.r.t. to sampling or Nyquist frequency, -3 dB vs. -6 dB vs. band-edge frequencies ... (This is due to the different backgrounds and the history of filter design algorithms and not Python-specific.)\r\n* **Fixpoint filter design for uCs:** Recursive filters have become a niche for experts. Convenient design and simulation support (round-off noise, stability under different quantization options and topologies) could attract more designers to these filters that are easier on hardware resources and much more suitable e.g. for uCs.\r\n* **Fixpoint filter design for FPGAs**: Especially on low-budget FPGAs, multipliers are rare. However, there are no good tools for designing and analyzing filters requiring a limited number of multipliers (or none at all) like CIC-, LDI- or Sigma-Delta based designs.\r\n* **HDL filter implementation:** Implementing a fixpoint filter in VHDL / Verilog without errors requires some experience, verifying the correct performance in a digital design environment with very limited frequency domain simulation options is even harder. The Python module [myHDL](http://myhdl.org) can automate both design and verification.\r\n\r\n### The following features are currently implemented:\r\n\r\n* **Filter design**\r\n    * **Design methods** from scipy.signal: Equiripple, Firwin, Butterworth, Elliptic, Chebychev 1 and Chebychev 2 \r\n    * **Remember all specifications** when changing filter design methods\r\n    * **Fine-tune** manually the filter order and corner frequencies calculated by minimum order algorithms\r\n    * **Compare filter designs** for a given set of specifications and different design methods\r\n    * **Filter coefficients and poles / zeroes** can be displayed, edited and quantized\r\n* **Clearly structured GUI**\r\n * only widgets needed for the currently selected design method are visible\r\n * enhanced matplotlib NavigationToolbar (nicer icons, additional functions)\r\n* **Common interface for all filter design methods:**\r\n * specify frequencies as absolute values or normalized to sampling or Nyquist frequency\r\n * specify ripple and attenuations in dB, as voltage or as power ratios\r\n * enter expressions like exp(-pi/4 * 1j) with the help of the library [simpleeval](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/simpleeval) (included in source files)\r\n* **Graphical Analyses**\r\n * Magnitude response (lin / power / log) with optional display of specification bands, phase and an inset plot\r\n * Phase response (wrapped / unwrapped)\r\n * Group delay\r\n * Pole / Zero plot\r\n * Impulse response and step response (lin / log)\r\n * 3D-Plots (|H(f)|, mesh, surface, contour) with optional pole / zero display\r\n* **Modular architecture**, facilitating the implementation of new filter design and analysis methods\r\n * Filter design files not only contain the actual algorithm but also dictionaries specifying which parameters and standard widgets have to be displayed in the GUI. \r\n * Special widgets needed by design methods (e.g. for choosing the window type in Firwin) are included in the filter design file, not in the main program\r\n * Filter design files can be added and edited *without* changing or even restarting the program\r\n* **Saving and loading**\r\n * Save and load filter designs in pickled and in numpy's NPZ-format\r\n * Export coefficients and poles/zeros as comma-separated values (CSV), in numpy's NPZ-format, in Excel (R) or in Matlab (R) workspace format\r\n* **Display help files** (own / Python docstrings) as rich text\r\n* **Runs under Python 2.7 and Python 3.4** \r\n\r\n**More screenshots from the current version:**\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td><img src = \"images/pyFDA_screenshot_3d_2.PNG\" alt=\"Screenshot\" width=300px></td>\r\n        <td><img src = \"images/pyFDA_screenshot_hn.PNG\" alt=\"Screenshot\" width=300px></td>        \r\n   </tr>\r\n    <tr>\r\n        <td><img src = \"images/pyFDA_screenshot_3d_3.PNG\" alt=\"Screenshot\" width=300px></td>\r\n        <td><img src = \"images/pyFDA_screenshot_PZ.PNG\" alt=\"Screenshot\" width=300px></td>\r\n    </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### Release 0.1 (target: end of <s>May</s> June 2015)\r\n\r\nThe following features are still missing for the first release. \r\n* Documentation\r\n\r\n### Release 0.2 (target: end of 2015) - Help is very welcome!\r\n* **scipy 0.16 SOS features**\r\n* **myHDL support**\r\n    * Export of VHDL / Verilog netlists for basic filter topologies\r\n    * Fixpoint simulation\r\n* **Filter coefficients and poles / zeros**<br />\r\nImplement model-view controller architecture for the following features:\r\n  * Display coefficients / poles and zeros with fewer digits while keeping full precision internally\r\n  * Group multiple poles / zeros\r\n  * Load coefficients / poles and zeros in various formats \r\n* **Filter Manager**\r\n  * Store multiple designs in one filter dict\r\n  * Compare multiple designs in plots\r\n* **Documentation using Sphinx**\r\n\r\n### Following releases\r\n* Better help files and messages\r\n* Add a tracking cursor\r\n* Graphical modification of poles / zeros\r\n* Export of filter properties as PDF / HTML files\r\n* Show error messages and warnings in the GUI\r\n* Design, analysis and export of filters as second-order sections\r\n* Multiplier-free filter designs (CIC, GCIC, LDI, SigmaDelta-Filters, ...)\r\n* Export of Python filter objects\r\n* Analysis of different fixpoint filter topologies (direct form, cascaded form, parallel form, ...) concerning overflow and quantization noise\r\n\r\n### Further ideas are\r\n* Wave-Digital Filters\r\n* test filters in real-time with a audio stream\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
