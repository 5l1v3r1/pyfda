The following goals of this FOSS project have been reached or will be in the near future:\r\n\r\n* Easy to use, clearly structured GUI\r\n* Accessing Scipy filter design methods with a common interface (frequency and amplitude specifications)\r\n* Easy switching between manual and minimum filter order without losing all the settings\r\n* Modular structure, facilitating the implementation of new filter design and analysis methods\r\n* Filter design files can simply be added to the filter_design subdirectory without changes to the program\r\n* Comfortable saving and loading of filter designs\r\n* Export of filter coefficients and poles / zeros as CSV and Matlab (R) workspace format\r\n\r\nPlans for the not-so near future include:\r\n* Quantization of filter coefficients\r\n* Multiplier-free filter designs (CIC, GCIC, SigmaDelta-Filters, ...)\r\n* Export of Python filter objects\r\n* Analysis of different fixpoint filter topologies (direct form, cascaded form, parallel form, ...) concerning overflow and quantization noise\r\n* Fixpoint filter sythesis and export using the myHDL module (<myhdl.org>)\r\n\r\nAnd maybe the future will bring\r\n* Wave-Digital Filters\r\n* ...\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
