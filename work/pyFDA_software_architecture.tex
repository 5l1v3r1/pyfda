\section{Overview}
\subsection{Class Structure and Hierarchy}
The following graphics have been created from the top directory using \textbt{pyreverse} (and they are only readable when zoomed in):

\texttt{pyreverse -o pdf -k --ignore=simpleeval.py,input\_target\_spec.py -p pyFDA .}

where 
\texttt{-k} only shows the class names (not the attributes and methods)
\texttt{-p} sets the project name that is the base for the filenames

\subsection{Libraries and Testing}
No proper testing strategy has been implemented so far (sorry!). However, all files / custom widgets can be run independently to test for syntactic correctness and basic functionality, especially of GUI elements. This has been achieved by the technique described in \url{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11536764/attempted-relative-import-in-non-package-even-with-init-py} :
\begin{quotation}
"`The python import mechanism works relative to the \verb|__name__| of the current file. When you execute a file directly, it doesn't have it's usual name, but has \verb|"__main__"| as its name instead. So relative imports don't work.

You can use \verb|import some_library| directly if you have this above your imports:
\begin{lstlisting}[style = pyStyle]
if __name__ == '__main__' and __package__ is None:
    from os import sys, path
    sys.path.append(path.dirname(path.dirname(path.abspath(__file__))))
\end{lstlisting}

You can use the \verb|__package__| attribute to ensure that an executable script files in a package can relatively import other modules from within the same package. The \verb|__package__| attribute tells that file what name it's supposed to have in the package hierarchy. See \url{http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0366/} for details."'
\end{quotation}

In this project, the following libraries and common files from the top level directory are used:

\begin{description}
\item [filterbroker.py] : This is the central file used as the data exchange hub where global dictionaries are defined (see section xxx). 
\item [pyfda\_lib.py] : This library contains some DSP and general helper functions.
\item [pyfda\_fixlib.py] : This library contains the fast fixpoint classes and methods.
\item [simpleeval.py] : With the help of this library simple expressions can be evaluated in line edit fields (see section xxx).
\end{description}

\begin{quotation}
"`If you have a script \verb|script.py| in package \verb|pack.subpack|, then setting it's \verb|__package__| to \verb|pack.subpack| will let you do \verb|from ..module import something| to import something from \verb|pack.module|. Note that, as the documentation says, you still have to have the top-level package on the system path. This is already the way things work for imported modules. The only thing \verb|__package__| does is let you use that behavior for directly-executed scripts as well."'
\end{quotation}

Another option is using the \verb|-m| option of the python interpreter. However, you can't run \verb|python -m core_test| from within the \verb|tests| subdirectory - it has to be from the parent, or you have to add the parent to the path. 
	

\subsection{Naming Conventions}
The following conventions have been adopted for naming instance names of UI widgets and layouts:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\textbf{QtGui Widgets}\\
lblXXX: &QLabels\\
cmbXXX: &QComboBox\\
chkXXX: &QCheckBox\\
butXXX: &QPushButton\\
tblXXX: &QTableWidget\\
frmXXX:	&QFrame\\
ledXXX:	&QLineedit\\
tabXXX:	&QTabWidget\\
spcXXX:	&QSpacerItem\\
\textbf{QtGui Layouts}\\
layVXXX: &QVBoxLayout\\
layHXXX: &QHBoxLayout\\
layGXXX: &QGridLayout\\
\end{tabular}

\section{Input Widgets}

\section{Plot Widgets}

\section{Filter Objects}
The structure of a filter file and the attributes and methods that need to be provided are described in this section.

When starting pyFDA, \texttt{filter\_tree\_builder.py} is run, extracting the relevant information from all *.py files found in the subdirectory filter\_design and building a hierachical tree in \texttt{filter\_broker.py}. 


When adding new filter objects \texttt{my\_filter.py} to an pyFDA installation, two things need to be kept in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\item copying it to the \texttt{filter\_widgets} directory
\item adding a line with the filename to the list of filter files \texttt{Init.txt} in the same directory.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Who needs you?}
A filter design object is instantiated dynamically every time the filter design method is changed in 

\texttt{input\_widgets/input\_filter.py} in \textbt{SelectFilter.setDesignMethod()}

The handle to this object is stored in \texttt{filterbroker.py} in \texttt{filObj}.

The actual design methods (LP, HP, ...) are called dynamically in \texttt{input\_widgets/input\_specs.py} in \textbt{InputSpecs.startDesignFilt()}.

An example for a design method is
\begin{lstlisting}[style = pyStyle]{}
def LPman(self, fil_dict):
	self.get_params(fil_dict)
	self.save(fil_dict, sig.ellip(self.N, self.A_PB, self.A_SB, self.F_PB, 
		btype='low', analog = False, output = frmt))
\end{lstlisting}

with the single parameter \texttt{fil\_dict}, that supplies the global filter dictionary containing all parameters and the designed filter as well. 

The local helper function \texttt{get\_params()} extracts parameters from the global filter dictionary and scales the parameters if required (as in the case for ellip routines):

\begin{lstlisting}[style = pyStyle]{}
def get_params(self, fil_dict):
 """
 Translate parameters from the passed dictionary to instance
 parameters, scaling / transforming them if needed.
 """
 self.N     = fil_dict['N']
 self.F_PB  = fil_dict['F_PB'] * 2 # Frequencies are normalized to f_Nyq
\end{lstlisting}

The local helper function \texttt{save()} saves the filter design back to the dictionary and the filter order and corner frequencies if they have been calculated by a minimum order algorithm.

\begin{lstlisting}[style = pyStyle]{}
def save(self, fil_dict, arg):
  """
  Store results of filter design in the global filter dictionary. Corner
  frequencies calculated for minimum filter order are also stored in the 
  dictionary to allow for a smooth manual filter design.
  """
  pyfda_lib.save_fil(fil_dict, arg, frmt, __name__)

  if self.F_PBC is not None: # has corner frequency been calculated?
    fil_dict['N'] = self.N # yes, update filterbroker
    if np.isscalar(self.F_PBC): # HP or LP - a single corner frequency
      fil_dict['F_PBC'] = self.F_PBC / 2.
    else: # BP or BS - two corner frequencies (BP or BS)
      fil_dict['F_PBC'] = self.F_PBC[0] / 2.
      fil_dict['F_PBC2'] = self.F_PBC[1] / 2.
\end{lstlisting}

The method

\subsection{Info strings}
All information that is displayed in \texttt{input\_widget/input\_info.py} in a \texttt{QtGui.QTextBrowser()} widget is provided in the multi line strings \textbt{self.info} and \textbt{self.info\_doc} in MarkDown format. They are analyzed and converted to HTML using \texttt{publish\_string} from \texttt{docutils.core}. \texttt{self.info} contains self-written information on the filter design method, \texttt{self.info\_doc} optionally collects python docstrings. See an excerpt from \texttt{ellip.py}:
 
\begin{lstlisting}[style=pyStyle]{}
self.info = """
**Elliptic filters**

(also known as Cauer filters) have a constant ripple :math:`A_PB` resp.
:math:`A_SB` in both pass- and stopband(s).

For the filter design, the order :math:`N`, minimum stopband attenuation
:math:`A_SB`, the passband ripple :math:`A_PB` and
the critical frequency / frequencies :math:`F_PB` where the gain drops below
:math:`-A_PB` have to be specified.

**Design routines:**

``scipy.signal.ellip()``
``scipy.signal.ellipord()``
"""

self.info_doc = []
self.info_doc.append('ellip()\n========')
self.info_doc.append(sig.ellip.__doc__)
self.info_doc.append('ellipord()\n==========')
self.info_doc.append(ellipord.__doc__)
\end{lstlisting}
